          <h4>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-nlj2RA4M0">St. Thomas of Villanova Day of Service</a>
            is an annual event where thousands of Villanova students gather and bus off to various service locations around the greater
            Philadelphia area. This year, I traveled with fellow computer science students and pre-med students 
            to Drexel Neumann Academy in Chester, PA. We worked together to clean up their school's basement and playground which needed
            a lot of work. The youtube video link provided above captures the spirit of this awesome Villanovan service event.</h4>

              around its title. Students meet weekly with underprivledged elementary students of the greater Philadelphia area
              to provide friendship, tutoring, and fun play time. Our section of the club focused on addressing social injustices 
              in the schools we serve and promoting positive change. During my service, I volunteered for North Light Community Center</h5>
