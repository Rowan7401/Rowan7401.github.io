          <h4>As a grade 8 youth soccer refereee, I worked as the center referee for competitive rec soccer games for ages U8-U12
            . I ensured all players demonstrated sportmanlike conduct and played the game within the rules. I coached players on basic
            concepts when they struggled to follow rules and encouraged players who were successful and correct in their play. When 
            over-enthusiastic coaches, parents, or players got out of hand, I used techniques learned in the training modules to 
            handle situations calmly and appropriately. Most of all, I made sure games were fun! </h4>
