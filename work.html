          <h4>Working as a Hardware Associate, I provide customer service to customers ranging from contractors who face
            tight deadlines and need their tools and equipment quickly, to DIY home improvement people who have less industrial
            needs. Besides organizing and stocking the aisles during downtime, I also complete the tedious process of re-keying 
            locks and cutting keys which requires a good amount of dexterity. Overall, I help ensure that customers can get in 
            and out of the highest grossing Home Depot of the region promptly, finding their items without difficulty. </h4>

          <h4>As a grade 8 youth soccer refereee, I worked as the center referee for competitive rec soccer games for ages U8-U12
            . I ensured all players demonstrated sportmanlike conduct and played the game within the rules. I coached players on basic
            concepts when they struggled to follow rules and encouraged players who were successful and correct in their play. When 
            over-enthusiastic coaches, parents, or players got out of hand, I used techniques learned in the training modules to 
            handle situations calmly and appropriately. Most of all, I made sure games were fun! </h4>
