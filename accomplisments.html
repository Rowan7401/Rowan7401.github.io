        <h5>The Villanova Leadership Program is a club hosted by two Villanova faculty, Jack Sherwood and Steve Koch, who are passionate
          about educating Villanova students about leadership and community. Throughout the semester, 6 leadership seminars are hosted by
        Jack and Steve with featured guest speakers. VLP members must attend and participate in 4 of 6 sessions to recieve the certificate.
        Each session highlights a different key component of strong leadership. Students are also encouraged network at sessions or 
        to participate in community builder activties outside of the sessions. Above, there is a photo of me and the other winners of the 
        free throw community builder contest. Also, above there is a photo of me at the VLP end of year dinner.

            questions to test their proficiency in Spanish. The exam requires students to be both strong readers
          and listeners of Spanish as audio clips of Native speakers and Spanish articles are the basis of the test questions. 
          I was awarded the bronze medal placing me in the top 10% of 160,000+ students. </h5>

          <h5>The Issaquah "School Pool" logo design contest was a competition put on by the
            Issaquah Parks and Recreation Department. Parks and Rec representatives tasked the Graphic Design II
          classes at Issaquah High to create a logo in Adobe Illustrator that would encourage students and parents to carpool
          or take other modes of transportation besides cars to reduce traffic. I presented my logo to the representatives
        and they chose mine to be displayed in various advertisements. An example is the the electrical box pictured to the left.</h5>
