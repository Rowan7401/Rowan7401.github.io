            award is given to high school athletes who demonstrate excellence both on and off the court. Coaches are asked to choose one player 
            from their team that is both dedicated to their studies, their sport, and their community. I was one of the 5 scholar athletes 
            selected during the Winter season. The website linked contains more information on why I was chosen. </h4>

          <h5>The National Spanish Examination is an online exam where students are asked a variety of 
            questions to test their proficiency in Spanish. The exam requires students to be both strong readers
          and listeners of Spanish as audio clips of Native speakers and Spanish articles are the basis of the test questions. 
          I was awarded the bronze medal placing me in the top 10% of 160,000+ students. </h5>

          <h5>The Issaquah "School Pool" logo design contest was a competition put on by the
            Issaquah Parks and Recreation Department. Parks and Rec representatives tasked the Graphic Design II
          classes at Issaquah High to create a logo in Adobe Illustrator that would encourage students and parents to carpool
          or take other modes of transportation besides cars to reduce traffic. I presented my logo to the representatives
        and they chose mine to be displayed in various advertisements. An example is the the electrical box pictured to the left.</h5>
